# DigitalCompetences
Website for Digital Competences

# How to use
All of the code I have written for the website is stored within the one file in index.html. 
This includes all of the styling for the website which I used CSS. 
The main website is writen in HTML. 

# How to get the code
You will need to make a pull request/clone the entire repository. 
This will download a folder of the entire project onto your personal computer. 
You would then be able to make changes to the code in a text editor (such as Visual Studio Code or Brackets). 

# Live website
The website is still live and functioning. 
It is currently running using a web hosting service by 000webhost.com. 
This is password secured, if you need the username and password we will be able to supply this. 
Changes made to the code here will not effect the live website which you have access to, it will only be local changes to your laptops version of the code. 
If you would like to change the live website with any changes you have made to the code here or on your personal machine, you will need to save them to the 000webhost server by changing the files stored on the server. 
If you need assistance with this I would be able to help with it. 

# Changes made to the code
If you do change any of the code and have a newer working version of the website and would like to store it on this GitHub Repository, you would need to first pull the origin to ensure no changes have been made while you have been editing the code, push the changes you have made to the repository and finally committ your changes that you have made to permanently store them within this repository. 

# Any other help
If you have any other questions or need any more help, just drop me an email on the email you have for me now and I will do my best to get back to you as soon as possible to help.
